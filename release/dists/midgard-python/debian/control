Description: Python bindings for Midgard Content Repository
 .
 This package provides Python bindings for Midgard2.
 .
 Midgard2 is an Open Source Content Repository. It provides an object-oriented  
 and replicated environment for building data-intensive applications for both
 web and the desktop. Midgard2 is built on the GNOME stack of libraries like 
 GLib and libgda. Communications between applications written in the different 
 languages happen over D-Bus.
